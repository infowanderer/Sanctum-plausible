### Why is this different?

> Most "secure storage" apps rely on "trust me bro" promises. Sanctum is **Cryptographically Deniable** with **Decentralized Storage**.

### Real-World Use Cases

**🗞️ Journalist Protecting Sources**
- Decoy: Published articles and public research notes
- Hidden: Confidential source documents and whistleblower communications
- Scenario: Device seized at border crossing - reveal decoy, sources stay protected

**✊ Activist in Authoritarian Regime**
- Decoy: Personal photos and innocuous social media content
- Hidden: Protest coordination plans and evidence of government abuse
- Scenario: Police raid - show decoy layer, cannot prove hidden content exists

**💰 Crypto Holder Under Duress**
- Decoy: Small wallet with $200 ("this is all I have")
- Hidden: Main wallet with life savings
- Scenario: $5 wrench attack - hand over decoy wallet, real funds stay safe

**🔔 Whistleblower Securing Evidence**
- Decoy: Work documents and meeting notes
- Hidden: Evidence of corporate fraud or government corruption
- Scenario: Employer demands access - show work files, evidence remains hidden

**🏠 Domestic Abuse Survivor**
- Decoy: Shared family photos and household documents
- Hidden: Escape plan, evidence of abuse, emergency contacts
- Scenario: Abuser demands access - show family content, safety plan protected

**🕵️ Intelligence Operative**
- Decoy: Tourist photos and travel itinerary
- Hidden: Mission briefings, contact networks, classified intelligence
- Scenario: Captured by hostile forces - reveal tourist cover, mission data stays secure

**🌍 Human Rights Defender**
- Decoy: Public advocacy materials and educational content
- Hidden: Witness testimonies and documentation of atrocities
- Scenario: Interrogation - reveal public work, witnesses stay anonymous

### Key Features

## 🎯 Advanced: Progressive Duress Tactic

**Strategy:** Create multiple vault triplets (panic/decoy/hidden) with progressively sensitive data to reveal incrementally under escalating duress while keeping the most critical secrets buried.

**How it works:**

```
Vault 1 (Low Sensitivity):
├─ Panic: "Vault deleted"
├─ Decoy: Public social media, family photos ($50 wallet)
└─ Hidden: Personal documents, small crypto wallet ($500)

Vault 2 (Medium Sensitivity):
├─ Panic: "Vault deleted"
├─ Decoy: Work files, meeting notes ($500 wallet)
└─ Hidden: Business contracts, medium crypto wallet ($5,000)

Vault 3 (High Sensitivity):
├─ Panic: "Vault deleted"
├─ Decoy: Old backups, archived projects ($5,000 wallet)
└─ Hidden: REAL SECRETS - whistleblower evidence, main wallet ($50,000+)
```

**Duress Response Protocol:**

1. **Initial Coercion** → Reveal Vault 1 decoy ("this is everything")
2. **Increased Pressure** → "Okay, I have a backup vault" → Reveal Vault 2 decoy
3. **Severe Duress** → "Fine, here's my real vault" → Reveal Vault 2 hidden layer
4. **Extreme Torture** → "I swear that's all!" → Reveal Vault 3 decoy
5. **Final Secrets** → Vault 3 hidden layer stays protected (adversary believes they got everything)

**Psychological Advantage:**
- Each "confession" appears genuine (real funds, real documents)
- Adversary's confidence increases with each reveal
- Final vault remains undiscovered ("why would there be more?")
- Cryptographically impossible to prove additional vaults exist

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create 3 separate vaults with different IPFS providers
Vault 1: Pinata (low sensitivity)
Vault 2: Filebase (medium sensitivity)  
Vault 3: Self-hosted IPFS node (high sensitivity)

# Store links separately
Vault 1 link: Memorized or written down
Vault 2 link: Password manager
Vault 3 link: Encrypted USB drive in safe location
```

**Best Practices:**
- Make each decoy layer believable (real transaction history, realistic amounts)
- Space out "confessions" (don't reveal all at once)
- Act reluctant when revealing each layer ("okay, you got me")
- Never mention the existence of multiple vaults
- Use different IPFS providers to avoid pattern detection

## 🐦 Warrant Canary

**[View Live Canary](https://sanctumvault.online/canary)** - Auto-updates with current timestamp on every visit


**Statement:**

As of the date above, Sanctum developers have:

✅ **NOT received any:**
- National Security Letters (NSLs)
- FISA court orders
- Gag orders preventing disclosure of legal demands
- Requests to implement backdoors or weaken encryption
- Requests to log user activity or decrypt user data
- Warrants requiring disclosure of user information

✅ **NOT been:**
- Compelled to modify source code
- Required to hand over cryptographic keys (none exist server-side)
- Forced to compromise the integrity of the system

✅ **Architecture guarantees:**
- Zero-knowledge: We cannot decrypt user vaults (client-side encryption)
- No user logs: We don't collect IP addresses, usage patterns, or metadata
- No backdoors: All code is open-source and auditable
- RAM-only: No persistent storage of keys or credentials

**Verification:**
- This canary is updated quarterly
- Signed commits verify authenticity
- If this section is removed or not updated for >90 days, assume compromise
- Check commit history: `git log --show-signature README.md`

**What We CAN Be Compelled To Do:**
- Take down the hosted service (users can self-host)
- Remove specific vault IDs from our database (data remains on IPFS)
- Provide encrypted vault metadata (useless without KeyA in URL)

**What We CANNOT Be Compelled To Do:**
- Decrypt user vaults (cryptographically impossible)
- Provide user passphrases (never transmitted to server)
- Log future user activity (architecture prevents it)

**If This Canary Dies:**
1. Assume legal compromise
2. Self-host immediately: `npm run dev`
3. Use Tor Browser for all vault access
4. Rotate all passphrases
5. Migrate to new IPFS providers

## 🔒 Operating Modes

### 1️⃣ Simple Secure Vault

**Use Case:** Secure backup of sensitive data without duress concerns.

Basic encrypted storage without deniability. Single encrypted blob uploaded to IPFS.

---

### 2️⃣ Duress Hidden (Current Implementation)

**Use Case:** $5 wrench attacks, device seizures, coercion scenarios.

**How it works:**

**Client-Side (Browser):**
1. User creates vault with decoy + hidden content
2. Browser encrypts both layers with XChaCha20-Poly1305
3. Uploads encrypted blobs to IPFS (Pinata/Filebase)
4. Generates split keys: KeyA (stays in URL) + KeyB (sent to server)
5. Server encrypts KeyB and stores with encrypted IPFS CIDs

**Server-Side (Cloudflare D1):**
- Stores: Encrypted KeyB, Encrypted CIDs, vault metadata
- **Two-stage cleanup** prevents database overflow:
  - **Stage 1**: Expired vaults marked inactive (`is_active = 0`) - soft delete
  - **Stage 2**: Vaults inactive for 30+ days permanently deleted
- **30-day grace period**: Accidentally expired vaults can be recovered

**Unlock Flow:**
1. User enters passphrase
2. Browser fetches encrypted metadata from server
3. Combines KeyA (from URL) + KeyB (from server) to decrypt IPFS CIDs
4. Downloads encrypted blobs from IPFS
5. Decrypts with passphrase → reveals decoy or hidden layer

**Passphrase Behavior:**
- **Empty/Decoy passphrase** → Shows decoy layer (innocent content)
- **Hidden passphrase** → Shows hidden layer (real secrets)
- **Panic passphrase** → Shows "vault deleted" error (duress protection)
- **Wrong passphrase** → Error: "Invalid passphrase"

**Error Messages (Plausible Deniability):**
All unavailable scenarios show identical message: `"Vault content has been deleted from storage providers"`
- Panic passphrase entered
- Vault expired (soft deleted)
- Vault doesn't exist
- IPFS blobs missing

**3-Layer Protection:**
1. **Decoy Layer** - Innocent content (optional)
2. **Hidden Layer** - Real secrets (required)
3. **Panic Layer** - Shows "vault erased" (cryptographically indistinguishable from real deletion)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React + Web Crypto API
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (static site, free tier)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (split-key storage)
- **Cryptography**: @noble/ciphers + @noble/hashes (XChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id)
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata/Filebase with public gateway fallback
- **State**: RAM-only (Web Workers, no persistence)
  - Keys never written to disk
  - Auto-wiped on browser close
  - Protected from disk forensics
  - Isolated in Web Worker memory
- **Backend**: Minimal (only split-key storage, no content access)

               │            • Decentralized storage
```

**Critical**: All encryption client-side. Server only stores encrypted fragments.

## 🛡️ Security: Attack Scenarios

### "Can I just reveal the passphrase under torture?"

**✅ YES, BY DESIGN.** Reveal the decoy layer. The adversary:
- Sees funded wallet + innocent files
- **Cannot prove** hidden layers exist
- Cryptographically indistinguishable from simple vault

### "What if they analyze the encrypted blob size?"

**✅ MITIGATED.** Each layer is padded to standard sizes, making size analysis unreliable.

### "Can they brute-force the passphrase?"

**❌ NO.** Argon2id with 256MB memory and 3 iterations makes brute-force computationally infeasible. Use strong passphrases (6+ Diceware words).

### "What if they perform disk forensics on my device?"

**✅ SAFE.** Sanctum uses RAM-only storage with zero disk persistence:
- No localStorage/sessionStorage for sensitive data
- Keys cleared on tab close
- Ephemeral salts regenerated per session
- Immune to disk carving and SSD wear-leveling analysis

See [RAM-ONLY-STORAGE.md](./docs/security/RAM-ONLY-STORAGE.md) for technical details.

### "What if they seize the IPFS providers?"

**✅ SAFE.** Data is encrypted before upload. Providers only see encrypted blobs. Without your passphrase and vault link, decryption is impossible.

### "What if they compromise Cloudflare Workers?"

**⚠️ LIMITED IMPACT.** Attacker gets encrypted metadata only. Cannot get: Passphrases, decrypted content, or KeyA (in URL).

### "What if I lose the vault link?"

**💀 LOST FOREVER.** No recovery mechanism exists (by design). **Save your links securely.**

### "Can I delete a vault after creating it?"

**❌ NO.** IPFS data is immutable. **Workaround:** Don't share the link.

---

## 🔐 OpSec Best Practices

1. **Anonymous IPFS accounts** - Create Pinata/Filebase accounts with anonymous emails (Tutanota, ProtonMail) via Tor Browser
2. **Fund decoy realistically** - $50-500 matching your financial status, include transaction history
3. **Memorize passphrases** - 12+ chars (uppercase, lowercase, number, special). Example: `MySecret#Vault2024`
4. **Use Tor Browser** - Hides IP, defeats timing attacks (100-500ms noise)
5. **Test before trusting** - Verify decoy unlocks, practice plausible deniability script
6. **Never reveal hidden layers** - Act natural, claim "this is all I have"
7. **Store links securely** - Password manager (KeePassXC/Bitwarden), never email/cloud
8. **Anti-keylogger** - Copy/paste from password manager, inspect USB ports

**Duress Response:** Reveal decoy passphrase only. Adversary cannot prove hidden layers exist (cryptographic guarantee).

## ❓ FAQ

### Why do I see 2 files on IPFS even with empty decoy?

**This is a security feature, not a bug.** Duress vaults always upload 2 encrypted blobs:

1. **Decoy blob** - Even if empty, creates cryptographic chaff
2. **Hidden blob** - Your actual secret content

**Security advantages:**
- **Metadata resistance** - Adversary cannot determine which blob is decoy vs hidden
- **Plausible deniability** - You can claim "I forgot the other passphrase" or "It's a backup"
- **Consistent behavior** - All vaults look identical (2 blobs, same size), preventing pattern analysis
- **Future-proofing** - Can add decoy content later without changing structure

Even "empty" encrypted blobs have minimum size (salt + nonce + auth tag + padding), making them indistinguishable from real data. This is exactly how VeraCrypt's hidden volumes work.

**The small IPFS storage cost (~few KB) is worth the security benefit.**

### How do I unlock a vault?

1. Open the vault link
2. Enter passphrase (no passphrase = decoy, correct passphrase = hidden)
3. Download or copy the decrypted content

### What if I lose the vault link?

**💀 LOST FOREVER.** No recovery mechanism exists (by design).

**Best practices:** Save in password manager, print QR code, never share over unencrypted channels

### What are the file size limits?

**Maximum: 25 MB** (per file, .zip or .rar archives supported)
